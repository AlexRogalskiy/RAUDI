# NETIFY

## Official Documentation
Reference: https://gitlab.com/netify.ai/public/netify-agent

## Description
The Netify Agent is a deep-packet inspection server.  The Agent is built on top of nDPI (formerly OpenDPI) to detect network protocols and applications.  Detections can be saved locally, served over a UNIX or TCP socket, and/or "pushed" (via HTTP POSTs) to a remote third-party server.  Flow metadata, network statistics, and detection classifications are stored using JSON encoding.
Add here the description of the specific tool.


## Usage
Run: 
```
docker run -it --cap-add=net_admin --rm secsi/netifyd -I/E <interface> -R 
```
to execute the script.   
You can also use in background without the `-R` flag: 

``` 
docker run -it --cap-add=net_admin --rm secsi/netifyd -I/E <interface> 

```

## üê≥ RAUDI: Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images

Hello, friend. This Docker Image has been created by RAUDI. What is RAUDI?

**RAUDI** (Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images) automatically generates and keep updated a series of *Docker Images* through *GitHub Actions* for tools that are not provided by the developers.

**RAUDI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.
