# GoogD0rker

## Official Documentation
Reference: https://github.com/ZephrFish/GoogD0rker/

## Description
GoogD0rker is a tool for firing off google dorks against a target domain, it is purely for OSINT against a specific target domain. This will output all the google results for each of the tasks so you can hopefully find a vunerability. A 503 error means you need a new IP as google knows you're up to something! This will output the results to files and then you can browse and see what you have found.
## Usage
```
docker run -it --rm secsi/googd0rker -d domain.com
```

## üê≥ RAUDI: Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images

Hello, friend. This Docker Image has been created by RAUDI. What is RAUDI?

**RAUDI** (Regularly and Automatically Updated Docker Images) automatically generates and keep updated a series of *Docker Images* through *GitHub Actions* for tools that are not provided by the developers.

**RAUDI** is what will save you from creating and managing a lot of Docker Images manually. Every time a software is updated you need to update the Docker Image if you want to use the latest features, the dependencies are not working anymore. 

This is messy and time-consuming. 

Don't worry anymore, we got you covered.
